          Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the
          infraorder Simiiformes, also known as the simians. Traditionally, all
          animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys
          except the apes, a grouping known as paraphyletic; however in the
          broader sense based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also
          included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regard of
          their scope.

          Monkeys are broadly split into two groups: Old World monkeys and New
          World monkeys. Old World monkeys live in Asia and Africa and have
          downward-pointing nostrils, according to Nature Education. New World
          monkeys live in North and South America and have outward-pointing
          nostrils.
